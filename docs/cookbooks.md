# Cookbook Gallery

Welcome to the OpenPerturbation **Cookbook Gallery** â€“ a curated collection of end-to-end, runnable examples that showcase the most common workflows in the platform.  Each notebook can be opened directly on GitHub or downloaded locally.

> **Tip:** The fastest way to get started is to clone the repository and launch JupyterLab:
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/llamasearchai/OpenPerturbation.git
> cd OpenPerturbation
> pip install -e .[dev]  # or: make install
> jupyter lab openperturbations/notebooks/
> ```
