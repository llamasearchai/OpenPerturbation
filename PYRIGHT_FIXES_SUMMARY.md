### Issues Resolved

This document summarizes the Pyright static analysis errors that were fixed in `src/data/processors/feature_extractor.py`.

### 1. Import Resolution Issues (reportMissingImports)

**Problem:** Pyright could not resolve skimage imports on lines 34-38
- `Import "skimage" could not be resolved`
- `Import "skimage.feature" could not be resolved`
- `Import "skimage.filters" could not be resolved`
- `Import "skimage.measure" could not be resolved`

**Solution:**
- Restructured the import strategy to import skimage modules individually
- Added proper fallback functions with correct type annotations
- Maintained backward compatibility with graceful degradation when scikit-image is not available

```python
# Before
try:
    import skimage
    from skimage import feature, measure, filters, morphology, io
    # ...
except ImportError:
    # Fallback functions without proper types

# After  
try:
    from skimage import feature as skimage_feature
    from skimage import measure as skimage_measure
    from skimage import filters as skimage_filters
    from skimage import morphology as skimage_morphology
    from skimage import io as skimage_io
    
    from skimage.feature import greycomatrix, greycoprops, blob_log
    from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu
    from skimage.measure import label, regionprops
    # ...
except ImportError:
    def greycomatrix(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> np.ndarray:
        return np.zeros((1, 1, 1, 1))
    # ... other properly typed fallback functions
```

### 2. Type Conversion Issues (reportArgumentType)

**Problem 1:** Line 435 - Tuple type conversion error
- `Argument of type "_T_co@tuple" cannot be assigned to parameter "x" of type "ConvertibleToFloat"`

**Problem 2:** Line 438 - Boolean assignment error  
- `Argument of type "float" cannot be assigned to parameter "value" of type "bool"`

**Solution:**
- Fixed the tuple type conversion in cross-modal correlation computation
- Added proper handling for different scipy versions
- Converted centroid tuples to lists for JSON serialization

```python
# Before
correlation_result = stats.pearsonr(trans_sample, image_sample)
correlation_value = float(correlation_result[0])  # Type error
centroids = [prop.centroid for prop in props]  # Tuple type issue

# After
correlation_result = stats.pearsonr(trans_sample, image_sample)
if hasattr(correlation_result, 'correlation'):
    # New scipy version returns object with .correlation attribute
    correlation_value = float(correlation_result.correlation)
else:
    # Older scipy version returns tuple
    correlation_value = float(correlation_result[0])

centroids = [list(prop.centroid) for prop in props]  # Convert to list
```

### 3. Additional Improvements

1. **Type Annotations:** Added proper return type annotations to all methods
2. **Error Handling:** Enhanced error handling throughout the module
3. **Dependencies:** Added scipy>=1.10.0 and scikit-image>=0.21.0 to requirements.txt
4. **Code Structure:** Improved overall code organization and maintainability

### 4. Testing Status

The fixes have been applied and the module now:
- ✅ Passes Pyright static analysis
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Handles missing dependencies gracefully
- ✅ Provides proper type safety

### 5. Dependencies Added

Updated `requirements.txt` with:
```
scipy>=1.10.0
scikit-image>=0.21.0
```
